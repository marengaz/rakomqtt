## About

A component to attach Rako lights (via the Rako bridge) to an mqtt broker for use with home assistant.
[Rako bridge interaction guide](accessing-the-rako-bridge.pdf).

Only tested with [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)

## Architecture

The docker container runs 2 processes

- `watcher` mode listens for the Rako bridge to broadcast change of state updates, then posts a home assistant compatible message to your mqtt broker
- `commander` mode subscribes to the home assistant command topic and upon receiving a message, posts a command to the Rako bridge via http

## Deploy

### Portainer
1. Install the [Home Assistant Portainer addon](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-portainer)
1. On the 'Containers' view, click  'Add Container'
    1. Name = rakomqtt
    1. Image = marengaz/rakomqtt
![name/image](img/create_container1.png)
    1. in 'Advanced container settings' > 'Command & logging'
        1. Command = ./start.sh --mqtt-host <your_host_ip> --mqtt-user <your_username> --mqtt-password <your_password> --debug 
![command](img/create_container2.png)
    1. in 'Advanced container settings' > 'Network'
        1. Network = host
        1. Hostname = <your_hostname>
![network](img/create_container3.png)
1. Click the 'Deploy the container' button
1. The container should now launch and be viewable in the 'Containers' tab 


### Find your RA-BRIDGE
There are a bunch of different ways to do this:

1. Download this code and run `python3 -m rakomqtt.RakoBridge` 
2. Log into your router and trawl through the devices connected to your LAN
3. Open Rako smartphone app. Click 'Rako' > 'Advanced' > 'Diagnostics'
    1. See 'Connected IP'


### Identify your rooms

Visit http://<RA-BRIDGE-IP>/rako.xml.
This will present a list of all the rooms in your house along with their internal ids 

### Home assistant light config

Use the Home assistant [mqtt light platform](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/light.mqtt/). 

#### Room scenes

Rako room scenes 1,2,3,4,off are mapped to home assistant brightness levels 255,192,128,64,0 respectively (1 being the brightest, 4 being the dimmest).

```yaml
- platform: mqtt
  name: <name of the room>
  schema: json
  state_topic: "rako/room/<rako-room-id>"
  command_topic: "rako/room/<rako-room-id>/set"
  brightness: true
```

For example
```yaml
- platform: mqtt
  name: Hallway
  schema: json
  state_topic: "rako/room/42"
  command_topic: "rako/room/42/set"
  brightness: true
```

#### Channel levels 

More granular control can be achieved with channel level commands. 

NOTE: When lots of channels are changed at once, it's possible the Rako bridge will drop some commands leaving some channels unchanged. 

NOTE: Rako's channel 0 in any room controls all the lights in that room

```yaml
- platform: mqtt
  name: <name of the room>
  schema: json
  state_topic: "rako/room/<rako-room-id>/channel/<rako-channel-id>"
  command_topic: "rako/room/<rako-room-id>/channel/<rako-channel-id>/set"
  brightness: true
```

For example
```yaml
- platform: mqtt
  name: Hallway Downlights
  schema: json
  state_topic: "rako/room/42/channel/1"
  command_topic: "rako/room/42/channel/1/set"
  brightness: true
```


## Dev

### Manual build and deploy:
SSH into your home assistant box and run this:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d --build
```

### Run

```bash
python -um rakomqtt
```
